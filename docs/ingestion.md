# Prepare sources and publish content

Run from the deployment repository root after setup. Source URLs, branches, and prefixes are defined by `plugins/words-net/plugin.json`; keep this manifest authoritative when updating component pins.

With the currently pinned plugin:

```sh
mkdir -p engine/sources
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch master https://github.com/aspose-words-mcp/docs.git engine/sources/documentation-current
git -C engine/sources/documentation-current sparse-checkout set en/net
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse --branch main https://github.com/aspose-words-mcp/reference.git engine/sources/api-reference
git -C engine/sources/api-reference sparse-checkout set english/net
```

The documentation repository is the fork configured by the existing plugin. If its public-release manifest changes, update these commands to match. Record both source commits and ensure the source working trees are clean before ingestion.

## Prepare external examples

```sh
PYTHONPATH=plugins/words-net/src plugins/words-net/.venv/bin/python \
  -m adcs_words_net.gist_examples \
  --source-root engine/sources/documentation-current/en/net \
  --cache plugins/words-net/sources/gist-examples.json
```

This network step prepares pinned Gist examples. The cache belongs beside the plugin, while source repositories belong under the `engine/` ingestion workspace. Retain cache provenance with publication records. Extraction uses the cache offline; do not run concurrent cache preparation against the same file.

## Validate

```sh
./scripts/ingest.sh --source-kind docs
./scripts/ingest.sh --source-kind apiref
```

Validation may write operation metadata but does not publish indexed content. `--stage` writes review staging. Configure runtime stores and embeddings before publication.

## Publish explicitly

After reviewing validation results:

```sh
./scripts/ingest.sh --source-kind docs --publish
./scripts/ingest.sh --source-kind apiref --publish
```

Use `--enqueue` with an active worker for durable queued jobs. Read an operation using:

```sh
./scripts/run-engine.sh -m adcs.plugins.cli --workspace "$PWD/engine" --job-status YOUR_OPERATION_ID
```

Source content, caches, credentials, and generated runtime data must not be committed. Verify actual documentation citations and API symbols through the deployed server after publication.
